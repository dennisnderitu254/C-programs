// Letâ€™s consider a problem. In a company, there are deductions from the salary of the
// employees for a fund. The deductions rules are as follows:
// i) If salary is less than 10,000 then no deduction
// ii) If salary is more than 10,000 and less than 20,000 then deduct Rs. 1,000 as
// fund
// iii) If salary is equal to or more than 20,000 then deduct 7 % of the salary for fund
// appropriate deduction show the net payable amount.
