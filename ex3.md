2. Using a loop, ask the user to enter positive integer numbers. The program will output the
number of values entered, the minimum value, the maximum value and the average of all
numbers. The code will exit once a negative integer is entered.
3. You have been commissioned by MMU Supermarket to write a program that will
determine the retail price of an item given suitable input. The pricing policy is that any
item that is expected to sell in one week or less is marked up 5% and any item that is
expected to stay on the shelf for more than one week is marked up 10% over the
wholesale price.
The input will consist of the wholesale price of an item and the expected number of days
until the item is sold. The program repeatedly asks for the input then displays the retail
price
4. Add loops in all the problems in Exercise 2.
5. Write a program that will print the pattern as shown below:
*
***

6. Write a program that permits a user to specify a number of lines and then prints on the
screen a pyramid of such height consisting of stars. The pyramid must be centered. Hints:
all characters are printed separately and both the number of stars per line and the number
of spaces per line must be calculated. The output will look like:
