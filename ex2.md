# BIT 2104: Programming Exercise 2:

1. A shopkeeper announces a package for customers that he will give 10 % discount on
all bills and if a bill amount is greater than 5000 then a discount of 15 %.
Write a program which takes amount of the bill from user and calculates the payable
amount by applying the above discount criteria and display it on the screen.

2. Suppose you want to associate noise loudness measured in decibels with the effect of
noise .The following table shows the relationship between the noise levels and human
perception of noise.
Loudness in decibels (db)
50 or lower
51-70
71-90
91-110
above 110
perception
quiet
Intrusive
Annoying
Very annoying
Uncomfortable
Write a program whose input is the loudness of noise in decibels and outputs the
human perception of the noise.


3. Write a switch statement that assigns to the variable marks the expected grade. Use
the following grading system.
Marks
Grade
70 -100
A
60 - 69
B
50 - 59
C
40 - 45
D
0 - 39
E

4. Letâ€™s consider a problem. In a company, there are deductions from the salary of the
employees for a fund. The deductions rules are as follows:
i) If salary is less than 10,000 then no deduction
ii) If salary is more than 10,000 and less than 20,000 then deduct Rs. 1,000 as
fund
iii) If salary is equal to or more than 20,000 then deduct 7 % of the salary for fund
Using a switch statement write a program that takes salary input from user and after
appropriate deduction show the net payable amount.


5. Write a program to compute the real roots of the equation: ax 2 +bx+c=0. The program
will prompt the user to input the values of a, b, and c. It then computes the real roots
of the equation based on the following rules:
-if a and b are zero=> no solution
-if a is zero=>one root (-c/b)
-if b2-4ac is negative=>no roots
-Otherwise=> two roots
The roots can be computed using the following formula:
1x1=-b+(b 2 -4ac) 1/2 /2a
x=-b-(b 2 -4ac) 1/2 /2a


6. Write a program that will calculate and print bills for a city power company. The
rates vary depending on whether the electricity use is residential commercial, or
industrial.
Code R means residential use, a code C means commercial use, and code I means
industrial use. Any other code should be treated as an error.
The rates are computed as follows:
R: Ksh. 500 plus Ksh. 4.8 per KWH. Used
C: Ksh. 50,000 for the first 1000 KWH and Ksh. 3.75 for each additional KWH.
I: rate varies depending on time of usage
Peak hours: Ksh. 68,000 for first 1000 KWH and Ksh. 5.60 for each additional KWH.
Off peak hours: Ksh. 37,000 for first 1000KWH and Ksh. 2.75 for each additional Ksh.
Your program should prompt the user to enter an integer account number, the user code (type
char), and the necessary consumption figures in whole numbers Kilowatts hours. Your
program should display the amount due from the user.
