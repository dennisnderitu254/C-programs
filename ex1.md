# BIT 2104: Programming Exercise 1

1. Rewrite the following mathematical
expressions using C expressions and functions
and write a simple program to implement each.
2
3
a) √ (u+v)+xw
b) √ ( x− y )
c) |xy -w/z|


2. Write a complete C program that prompts the
user for the Cartesian coordinates of two
points (x 1 , y 1 ) and (x 2 ,y 2 ) and displays the
distance between them using formula.
2
2
distance = √ ( x 1 −x 2 ) +( y 1 − y 2 )

3. Write a C program that prompts for a, b and x
and calculates.
Side = √ a 2 +b 2 – 2a b cos x

4.
Write a program that takes radius of a circle
from the user and calculates the diameter,
circumference and area of the circle and
display the result.

5.
Write a program that takes the days as input
and outputs the months and days ( Hint months
= days/30, days = days%30).6.
Write a program that takes a four digits integer
from user and shows the digits on the screen
separately i.e. if user enters 7531, it displays
7,5,3,1 separately.
